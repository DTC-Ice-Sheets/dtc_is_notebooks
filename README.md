# DTC Ice Sheets — Notebooks

This repository hosts the Jupyter demonstrator notebooks developed for the **DTC Ice Sheets Project**, part of the
European Space Agency’s Digital Twin Earth (DTE) initiative. The project is conducted under the Lead Digital Twin
Components (DTC) Development Actions for the Ice Sheets.

The objective of the DTC Ice Sheets Project is to design, implement, and validate a pre-operational Digital Twin
Component (DTC) focused on Ice Sheets and Ice Shelves. This DTC integrates Earth Observation (EO) data with advanced
computational modeling and stakeholder engagement to address critical topics in ice shelf stability, Greenland ice sheet
hydrology, mass balance, and climatology.

The DTC addresses four specific use cases:

- 🔋 **Hydropower** (led by Lancaster University) – Predict climatically driven changes to freshwater flux from the
Greenland Ice Sheet into the proglacial environment.
- 🌊 **EU Sea Level Response Fingerprint** (led by Technical University of Denmark) – Simulate and predict the impact
of melting ice sheets on sea levels within the EU.
- ❄️ **State and Fate of Antarctic Ice Shelves** (led by University of Edinburgh) – Provide up-to-date reconstructions
of Antarctic Ice Shelves and their interactions with the ice sheet, atmosphere, and ocean, and forecast their evolution.
- 🌍 **Enhanced Surface Climate** (led by Katholike Universiteit Leuven) – Leverage super-resolution modeling
techniques to enhance the monitoring and prediction of surface climate conditions over Greenland and Antarctica.
